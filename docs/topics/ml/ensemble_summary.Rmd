<p id="title">Ensemble Learning</p>

<br><br>

<p id="desc">Ensemble is really useful. It's going through several machine learning algorithms and parameters over 1 or many datasets. We do this to see which algorithms may perform better for a certain dataset, or certain types of datasets.<br><br>I have attached a certain ensemble I assembled with a team of 3 people, which report and code I created. In this ensemble, we analyzed 8 different data sets with 6 different algorithms, 3 of which we had 2 sets of parameters, and did every algorithm with 2 different <i>cross validation</i> amounts, making 18 total algorithm combinations.</p>

<p id="desc">The purpose of the report was to visualize how the different algorithsm perform. We observed that the <strong>Naive Bayes</strong> algorithm varied the most in accuracy, <strong>row amount</strong> wasn't a factor, the amount of <strong>unique targets</strong> strongly affects the accuracy across all algorithms (as expected), and for the most part the algorithms performed about the same across all datasets, which attests to the <strong>no free lunch theory</strong>, which states that across all possible datasets, all algorithms perform about the same.</p>
