<p id = "title">KNN Regression</p>

<br><br>

<p id = "desc">As part of my senior project analysis with <i>Colorado Climate Data</i> provided by <i>NRCS</i>, I decided to replace some missing values with estimates created from the <strong>KNN regression</strong> provided through <i>SKLEARN</i>.<br><br>In my dataset, I have <i>15 day high temperature</i> averages for 114 stations, many of whose observations had readings which are probably not correct, as shown by the below <i>boxplot.</i></p>

<p id="desc">As seen from above, the black and red dots show the supposed outliers, whose values we will re-predict with the KNN regression method.<br><br>With KNN regression we can take the middle 98% or so of the data (which we believe to be a lot more accurate readings), and use that to find rows in the corrupted data to with like attributes, and estimate what should have been it's actual value.<br><br>The following with be provided to reference: the <i>r</i> script used to format the data, the <i>python</i> script used to run the actual regression, and the <i>r</i> script used to do some visualization and data wrangling. Keep in mind that I also estimated values for <i>other problems</i> I also had in the data.</p>
