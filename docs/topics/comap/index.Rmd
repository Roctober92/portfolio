<p id = "desc">In February 2018, I participated in BYU-Idaho's first ever team in the <a href="http://www.comap.com" target="_blank">COMAP International Mathematical Modeling Competition</a>. For this competition, we were given the choice between 6 different prompts, and were given 4 days to create a mathematical model that would offer a solution to our selected.</p>

<p id = "desc"><i>Our analysis included the following steps:</i></p>

<br>

<ul id="list">
  <li id="bullet"> Summarizing the task in bullets to understand it better</li>
  <li id="bullet"> Researching climate science and political stability principles</li>
  <li id="bullet"> Reviewed machine learning algorithms to remind ourselves of their capabilites</li>
  <li id="bullet"> Went through an iterative process of defining how to represent climate change - <i>we eventually chose temperature</i></li>
  <li id="bullet"> Went through another iterative process of defining the relationship between temperature and stability</li>
  <li id="bullet"> Created a report through LaTex</li>
  <li id="bullet"> Edited and revised throughout the next 2 months</li>
  <li id="bullet"> Created and presented a <a id = "pp" href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18mVmyFbIehldOca_lHySLG-OuJ_Gmr8nJeMBZv0FEBk/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">PowerPoint</a> at MAA Math Convention in Logan, Utah.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<p id = "desc">The following link is our submitted report to the COMAP committee. In the end, we summarized that when the yearly average temperature change is greatest over a 5 year period, that is when the political stability is the most likely to change as a result. We also argued that the weaker the state, the more susceptable to climate change. <i>(Note that the following report is the not latest report, and was changed to make the above linked powerpoint)</i></p>
